      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="note">
        This Privacy Policy applies to Streamn Dad (StreaMN Dad) and its associated

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        This website does not collect personal information through forms, logins, or
        analytics. Any information associated with livestreams or social posts is
        publicly available on the platforms where it appears. Streamn Dad does not
        use third-party analytics, trackers, or advertising pixels.
      </p>

      <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
      <p>
        Publicly available information (such as videos, descriptions, or public
        comments) may be used only to share, organize, or improve livestreams and
        highlight content for the community. No private data is sold or shared.
      </p>
